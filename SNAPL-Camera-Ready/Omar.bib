  abstract = {While the C programming language provides good support for writing efficient, low-level code, it is not adequate for defining higher-level abstractions relevant to embedded software. In this paper we present the mbeddr technology stack that supports extension of C with constructs adequate for embedded systems. In mbeddr, efficient low-level programs can be written using the well-known concepts from C. Higher-level domain-specific abstractions can be seamlessly integrated into C by means of modular language extension regarding syntax, type system, semantics and {IDE}. In the paper we show how language extension can address the challenges of embedded software development and report on our experience in building these extensions. We show that language workbenches deliver on the promise of significantly reducing the effort of language engineering and the construction of corresponding {IDEs}. mbeddr is built on top of the {JetBrains} {MPS} language workbench. Both {MPS} and mbeddr are open source software.},

  shorttitle = {{TouchDevelop}},
  abstract = {The world is experiencing a technology shift. In 2011, more touchscreen-based mobile devices like smartphones and tablets will be sold than desktops, laptops, and netbooks combined. In fact, in many cases incredibly powerful and easy-to-use smart phones are going to be the first and, in less developed countries, possibly the only computing devices which virtually all people will own, and carry with them at all times. Furthermore, mobile devices do not only have touchscreens, but they are also equipped with a multitude of sensors, such as location information and acceleration, and they are always connected to the cloud. {TouchDevelop} is a novel application creation environment for anyone to script their smartphones anywhere -- you do not need a separate {PC}. {TouchDevelop} allows you to develop mobile device applications that can access your data, your media, your sensors and allows using cloud services including storage, computing, and social networks. {TouchDevelop} targets students, and hobbyists, not necessarily the professional developer. Typical {TouchDevelop} applications are written for fun, or for personalizing the phone. {TouchDevelop}'s typed, structured programming language is built around the idea of only using a touchscreen as the input device to author code. It has built-in primitives which make it easy to access the rich sensor data available on a mobile device. In our vision, the state of the program is automatically distributed between mobile clients and the cloud, with automatic synchronization of data and execution between clients and cloud, liberating the programmer from worrying (or even having to know about) the details. We report on our experience with our first prototype implementation for the Windows Phone 7 platform, which already realizes a large portion of our vision. It is available on the Windows Phone Marketplace.},

  abstract = {Modern integrated development environments (IDEs) offer
  recommendations to aid development, such as auto-completions, refactorings,
  and fixes for compilation errors. Recommendations for each code location are
  typically computed independently of the other locations. We propose that an
  IDE should consider the whole codebase, not just the local context, before
  offering recommendations for a particular location. We demonstrate the
  potential benefits of our technique by presenting four concrete scenarios in
  which the Eclipse IDE fails to provide proper Quick Fixes at relevant
  locations, even though it offers those fixes at other locations. We describe
  a technique that can augment an existing IDE's recommendations to account
  for non-local information. For example, when some compilation errors depend
  on others, our technique helps the developer decide which errors to resolve
  first.},
